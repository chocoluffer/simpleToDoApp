# Simple Todo Web App
Developed as an entry project for a native app development class my Junior year (2015).<br>
We were given a skeleton project and asked to design it and develop a few additional functions for it.<br><br>
What I wrote:
* All of the custom styling (main.css)
* Wrote archiveToDo function (archives the tasks instead of destroying them)
* Wrote undoDel function (retrieves archived tasks, starting with the most recently deleted ones)
* Wrote tidyTasks function (goes through local storage and cleans up the nulls)
